Overtaking Sight Distance19-08-20232Overtaking/Passing Sight Distance
If all the vehicles travel at the same speed, there is no need for providing Overtaking 
Sight distance (OSD)
However, different vehicles aswell asdifferent drivers, travel with different speeds, and
therefore, itisnecessary toprovide OSD .OSD isprovided sothat vehicles travelling at
the design speed can safely overtake slow -moving vehicles without collision with the
vehicle coming from theopposite end
Definition :Itisthe minimum distance open tothe vision ofthe driver ofavehicle
intending toovertake aslow -moving vehicle ahead with safety against the traffic ofthe
opposite direction .
The OSD is also known as Passing Sight Distance (AASHTO Green Book)
It is the distance measured along the centre of the road which a driver with his eye level 
at 1.2 m above the road surface can see the top of an object 1.2 m (basically eye level of 
another passenger car) above the road surface.

Overtaking Sight Distance
The yellow car (overtaking car) wants to overtake the grey car (overtaken car) without 
colliding with the white car coming from the opposite direction. 
The sight distance needed for doing this maneuver safely iscalled overtaking sight
distance (OSD) orPassing sight distance(PSD) .
Can you outline thefactors affecting theOSD??19-08-20234Overtaking/Passing Sight Distance
Factors affecting the overtaking sight distance
Speed ofallthevehicles (overtaking, overtaken, and vehicle coming from opposite end)
Distance between thevehicles ;this also depends onthespeed
Skills and reaction time ofthedriver
Rate ofacceleration ofovertaking vehicle
Gradation oftheroad (higher requirement)

2=Distance travelled bythe overtaking vehicle during the actual overtaking (i.e.
accelerating thespeed, going toopposite lane, crossing the overtaken vehicle and coming
back thetheleftlane)
3=Distance travelled bythevehicle coming from opposite direction19-08-20237Overtaking Sight Distance: IRC Method
Lets derive the expression for OSD
The overtaking vehicle isforced toreduce itsspeed from thedesign speed (m/sec) to
(m/sec) ofthe slow vehicle and move behind it,maintaining aclear spacing of
metres tillthere isanopportunity forsafe overtaking operation .This distance will not
beincluded intheOSD since noovertaking isdone
The driver finds anopportunity toovertake .During this perception -reaction time (),
the driver travels some distance with the reduced speed only i.e.(m/sec) before

Some Important Points
Effect ofGradient onOSDOvertaking Sight Distance: IRC Method
Ascending Gradients
The OSD requirement increases (than level roads) due toreduced acceleration ofthe
overtaking vehicle and increased speed ofthe vehicle coming from the opposite
direction (for him, itwill bedeceleration and hence higher speed)
However, inmost cases, the overtaken vehicle isaheavily loaded truck which usually
loses some speed onappreciable ascending gradients and many drivers are aware of
the greater distances needed forovertaking ;both these conditions compensate and
thus the same OSD provided atthe level roads could beprovided atascending mild
gradients (upto ruling gradient forplain and rolling terrains)
Ondescending gradients, itiseasier forthe overtaking vehicle toaccelerate and pass ;
however, the overtaken vehicle may also accelerate and cover agreater distance .This
compensates tosome extent .
However, atsteeper gradients ,theOSD shall beincreased proportionally19-08-2023 17
Overtaking ZonesOvertaking Sight Distance: IRC Method
Itisalways desirable tohave OSD atevery point ofthe road .However, this is
practically notpossible and may significantly increase thecost oftheproject
Efforts should bemade toprovide overtaking zones atfrequent intervals for the
vehicles travelling atthedesign speed
Inthis case, sufficient information shall begiven tothe drivers about the overtaking
zones byproviding sign boards
Minimum length oftheOvertaking Zone =3
Desirable length oftheOvertaking Zone =5Two sign posts shall beprovided atdifferent distances
oSignpost 1(SP1):Itindicates that overtaking zone isahead and itmust be

Difference between IRC and AASHTO Method?? 
19-08-202336Overtaking/Passing Sight Distance: AAHSTO Method
The basic principle ofdesigning the overtaking zone orovertaking sight distance is
almost thesame totheIRC method with thefollowing differences :
i. Inthe IRC,the initial distance (1)travelled was during the perception -reaction time
only i.e.2seconds and noacceleration was made bythe driver .However, asper
AASHTO, there will besome acceleration made bythe driver tomove towards the
centre line oftheroad ;however, this initial acceleration issignificantly lower than the
maximum potential ofthevehicle .Due totheinclusion ofinitial acceleration, thetotal
duration isbetween 3.7-4.3seconds ,depending onthespeed .19-08-202337Overtaking/Passing Sight Distance: AAHSTO Method

the spacing maintained bythe Overtaking vehicle, before and after the overtaking
maneuver (i.e.+2)19-08-202339Overtaking/Passing Sight Distance: AAHSTO Method
iii. InIRC, the overtaking distance had three components .Whereas inAASHTO, the
passing sight distance issplit into 4distances i.e.1+2+3+4.The extra
distance (3)isthe clear distance between the overtaking vehicle atthe end ofits
maneuver and thevehicle coming from theopposite direction .
The 3distance isgenerally between 30-75mdepending onthespeed ofthevehicles .
iv. InIRC, 3which is4inAASHTO, isthedistance traveled bythevehicle coming from
the opposite direction during the overtaking maneuver duration i.e.Tseconds .
However, asper AASHTO, considering the total duration leads toalarge sight
distance and would not becost -effective ;especially, when aclear distance (3)of30-
75misalready being considered .19-08-202340Overtaking/Passing Sight Distance: AAHSTO Method

Itisassumed that the overtaking vehicle once decided toovertake, will Definitely
complete theovertaking maneuver .This means the driver has noopportunity toabort

Due tothe longer sight distance requirement ,the cost ofthe project increases
dramatically and therefore, many researchers have developed models which outline
smaller SAFE passing sight distanceThis assumption isbelieved toresult inthe exaggeration ofthe overtaking sight
distance requirements .19-08-202345Glennon Model
There are numerous models which consider that the passing sight distance shall give
the driver both options viz.tocomplete the overtaking maneuver aswell astoabort
themaneuver .
Glennon model isbased onthe hypothesis that acritical position exists during the
passing maneuver where the passing sight distance requirement toeither complete or
abort thepass isequal .Atthis point, thedecision tocomplete thepass will provide the
same head -onclearance toanopposing vehicle aswill the decision toabort the pass .
This distance can beconsidered astheoptimum passing sight distance .Glennon model isthemost famous among alltheavailable models
Considering the critical position concept could reduce the passing sight distance
requirement and subsequently thecost oftheproject
Lets understand this concept inmore detail19-08-202346Glennon Model
Phase I:Start ofPass i.e.when thedriver decides toovertake
OSD

When the overtaking vehicle maintaining acritical distance offrom the overtaken
vehicle decides toovertake but sees the opposite vehicle, hewill not atallperform the
overtaking maneuver .Inthis case, the OSD/PSD requirement forAborting will bethe
minimum but thePSD required forovertaking will themaximum
Phase II:Early Part ofPass i.e.when thedriver isonthecentre line
OSD

When thedriver isonthecentre line oftheroad and sees theopposite vehicle, thetime
required toABORT themanuever will behigher than Phase I(because thedriver has to
return back behind the impeding vehicle) and subsequently, the distance required .In
this case, theOSD/PSD requirement forAborting will behigher than inPhase I.19-08-202347Glennon Model
Phase III:Middle ofPass i.e.when thedriver iscompletely ontheopposite lane
OSD

When the driver iscompletely onthe opposite lane and hecan perform both the
maneuvers safely i.e.ABORT aswell asCOMPLETE ;this distance iscalled the Critical
Distance .
Phase IV:Later Part ofPass i.e.when thedriver isahead oftheimpeding vehicle
OSD

Inthis case, the OSD required toabort will the maximum, but the OSD required to
COMPLETE will betheminimum .Distance required toabort isequal todistance required toabort19-08-202348Glennon Model
Out ofallthese conditions, thecritical point/distance wherein thedistance required to
abort isequal tothe distance required tocomplete the overtaking maneuver, will give
thedriver both theoptions and thus, could beconsidered fordesigning theOSD orPSD
Lets understand theGlennon model forestimating thePSDPhase Overtaking driver position PSD for Aborting PSD for completing 
overtaking

II Road Centre line Higher than Phase I Lower than Phase I
III Opposite lane behind impeding

Assumption made byGlennon
1)The overtaking and the vehicle coming from the opposite direction
(oncoming/opposing vehicle) aretravelling with thesame speed i.e.thedesign
speed ofthehighway ()
2)The overtaken vehicle (passed/impeding vehicle) travels atauniform speed
which is19kmph lower than that oftheovertaking vehicle i.e.=19kmph
3)The length ofthepassing ()and thepassed/impeding ()vehicles is5.8m.
4)The passing drivers perception -reaction time indeciding toabort passing a
vehicle is1s.
5)Ifapassing maneuver isaborted, the passing vehicle will use adeceleration
rate ()of3.4/2,thesame deceleration rate used instopping sight distance
design criteria
6)For acompleted oraborted pass, the space headway between the passing and
passed vehicles is1s.
7)The minimum clearance between the passing and opposing vehicles atthe
point atwhich thepassing vehicle returns toitsnormal lane is1s
Based on these assumptions, Glennon gave two time -space diagrams ;one for
completed maneuver and theother foraborted maneuver19-08-202350Glennon Model
